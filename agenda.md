# Introductions

What interested in w/ Coding? Why interested in Elixir?
Asking Questions

- Name, Where from?
- How long Coding?
- Why interested in Elixir?

---

# Future Talks / Trainings

Anyone w/ Elixir experience or interest want to help w/ Future sessions?
Talks, Training ... Please let me know.

Goal is to get momentum w/ Elixir meetup in SD.

---

# Find a Pair

Please find another person to pair with.
Better to discuss as go.

If don't have Elixir installed, may want to pair w/ someone who does.

---

# Installing Elixir

Install Elixir / Erlang (5-10 mins)
Hopefully all are installed, but if not weâ€™ll take some time now.
https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

Mac:
Update your homebrew to latest: brew update
Run: brew install elixir

Windows: Run the Installer
Linux: Many varieties.

If can't figure out, pair w/ someone who has it installed.

# High Level Plan

~1st hr:
Intros
FP vs OOP
Quick Syntax Overview
Cards App Exercises

~2nd hr:
Exercism.io in pairs

~3rd hr:
Look at some other apps
Try to get running
Will be good exposure to Phoenix and Live View
Look under /apps directory

- Image App
- Sea Battle
  Try to get running
  Ask questions

Will see how much time we have and can adjust.

# Functional Programming (FP) vs Object Oriented (OO) vs Imperative

### Object Oriented

Object Oriented (OO)
Classes / Instances (Prototypes)
Stateful Objects
Behavior / State
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Stateful
Mutable

Language Examples:
Ruby
Javascript
Python
Java
PHP

### Functional Programming

Functions
Data Structures
Data Transformations
Transparent
No Instances/Classes, Just Functions/Modules
Composition
Immutable

Language Examples:
Elixir
Clojure
Haskell
Elm
Scala

Can write in a functional style
Ruby, JS, Python, Etc can be written in Functional Style but aren't Functional Languages

### Imperative

Sequential Steps
Control Flow

C
Golang
Rust
Ruby
Python

# Approach to Training/Exercises

Work through some real code examples first
Learn to Run the code, Debug, try playing around

IMO, This is a faster and more natural way to learn. For example, learning Music, one hears the song first then over time learns to play. Learning language, hear some of it spoken and then learn.

Then we'll learn some Syntax AFTER reading the code. Time for a lot of questions about syntax later.

Various Projects We'll Play with depending on time.
Then talk and ask questions to see what we can learn

If want to go through some Tutorials, Books, Resources to build up the examples from Scratch

All will be provided

Sample Apps we'll Play With
Stephen Grider Udemy Course Examples

- Cards
- Github Image Generator
- Exercism.io Example(s)
- Harder App

---

# Useful Commands

cd cards
iex -S mix

### useful iex commands

recompile
ctl c (exit shell)

- Modules in Elixir are Collections of Functions
- No Instances or State
- Just Functions that take inputs and return values

---

# Concepts to Know

- Immutability
- Pattern Matching
- Arrays vs Tuples vs Lists
- Erlang in Elixir
- Compiling (Elixir->Erlang AST->BEAM)
- Atoms vs Strings (Binaries)
