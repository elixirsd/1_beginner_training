# Get additional Apps running

Look at some of the Additional Apps provided.

Try to get them runnning and figure out what they do.

(Note: Some are Phoenix apps and will require more setup.)

After get one or a few running,
Look through the code and write down questions.

It may be trickier to install, as these are Phoenix Apps.
Will need to install Phoenix.

Useful commands:

```
mix deps.get
cd assets && npm install
cd ..
iex -S mix phx.server
```

Try debugging the program w/ `IO.inspect`
Can also play around IEx.pry

We will discuss as a group.

_Warning:_ cards.one is a cool game but requires trickier installation.
Will need to install Redis and have running.
Also, will need Elm.
